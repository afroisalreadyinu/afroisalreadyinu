# This is Ulas Turkmen's Github profile you are looking at

The name is pronounced as in *Ooh-lush Turk-mehn*

I'm a developer with expertise in building and running online applications. I
have always aimed to keep things easy to understand, extend, scale, debug and
deploy. Here are a couple of entry points to my contributions:

- [miniboss](https://github.com/afroisalreadyinu/miniboss) is a tool for testing
  container clusters locally. It's docker-compose with lifecycle events right
  now, but I intend to add load testing and pytest integration soon.

- [stashpy](https://github.com/afroisalreadyinu/stashpy) is a replacement for
  Logstash that offers much better testability and easier configuration. Also,
  it's in Python, so those who know the language can build on it.

- I wrote a number of tutorials on
  [Ansible](https://github.com/afroisalreadyinu/practical-ansible-intro),
  [Kubernetes](http://okigiveup.net/a-tutorial-introduction-to-kubernetes/) and
  [AWS](http://okigiveup.net/discovering-aws-with-cli-part-1-basics/), here and
  on my blog.

Working on web software, you inevitably get entangled with all things
browser-related -- JavaScript, CSS, browser APIs etc. I'm comfortable working in
this domain, but it's not my main focus.

In a previous career, I did a PhD in Cognitive Science. This gave me the chance
to read and think about all kinds of interesting topics (you can read my PhD
thesis titled Situated Concepts and Pre-Linguistic Symbol Use
[here](https://repositorium.ub.uni-osnabrueck.de/handle/urn:nbn:de:gbv:700-201006076293?mode=full)),
and I'm fairly well-versed in topics related to AI, machine learning, data
mining and computational linguistics, but I don't primarily work in these areas,
and the deep learning stuff is quite above my head.
